                Trevor tells us about apartheid and how it affected his life in Chapter 1.
                Trevor has grown up during apartheid. Having a black mother and a swiss father it was unsafe for Trevor to 
            be seen  with his parentsin the public.When Trevor 
            visited his grandparents in Soweto,his grandmother 
            didn't allow him to play outside with his cousins 
            becausehe could be taken by the police.Trevor used 
            to entertain himself indoors.Racism is also depicted 
            in Uganda where many citizens are discriminated in the 
            employment sector especially in the government 
            positions .
                 The value of resilience is one thing we may take away. Despite the obstacles and limitations he had to deal with, 
                Trevor managed to handle trying circumstances with humor.
                Every day, I choose to carry on with a smiling face despite all the challenges.

                The attention moves to Trevor's mother Patricia in Chapter 2. 
                Her example shows us the depth of a mother's love and the extent she will go to to keep her child safe. 
                Patricia is an example to never give up and to always stand up for what you believe in because of her unwavering support and fiery independence. 
                She also bears the same characteristics as most mothers in my subcounty who choose to care for their children despite all the mocking from society on ways they bore their children.

                These chapters emphasize the value of embracing your individuality and speaking out against injustice in general.
                 Trevor's experiences demonstrate the role of family in oneâ€™s life and how family influences our behaviours and outlook on life.
